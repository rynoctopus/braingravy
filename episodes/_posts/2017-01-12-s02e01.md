summary: Hey folks this is Heckman and your listening to the first episode of season 2 for Brain Gravy. I want to thank you as the listener, as we go into season 2 of Brain Gravy we will continue to improve the audio quality, enhance the live video stream, and continue to bring interesting and unique guest on the show. With this new season brings some exciting announcements as we go into 2017. The first being that Brain Gravy has a new website – www.braingravy.org. You can now find all our episodes here, along with additional content for each episode including the video of the episode if you choose to watch instead of listen. What this also means is that we switched our hosting service, and had to start a new iTunes account for the podcast due to that switch, I apologize for this inconvenience, but it was necessary to continue to provide you this podcast completely free. We only ask that you re-subscribe to us ON iTunes. 

All right, in this episode we have on Rochester comedian and women’s rights activist Kelsey Claire Hagen. Kelsey Claire is one of my favorite local comics, and has recently begun to make a name for herself by organizing the event “Don’t Grab My Pussy”. Recently this event raised over $3000 to support Restore by Planned Parenthood. Restore is a program committed to sexual violence education, counseling and advocating for survivors of sexual assault. 

So without further ado, here is the latest episode of Brain Gravy.
